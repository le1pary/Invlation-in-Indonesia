Inflation in Indonesia, LSTM, MAPE, MAE, RMSE, R2
</h3>

# Invlation-in-Indonesia
Dataset Of Invlation In Indonesia. from the data, visitor can use to predict and analysis about inflation rate with Python and making the good model.
For me, I use the Python code with Visual Studio Code, and then I write the line code, analysis, createing the model, predicting, and evaluate the model with MAPE,MAE,RMSE, and R Square. the output in my work is prediction about inflation rate in Indonesian cities, also i write the result and analysis in article journal. 
You all, can see the dataset, and I hope we can colaborated. happy learn All...!
